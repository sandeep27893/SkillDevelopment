Scrum ceremonies, also known as Scrum events, are specific meetings and activities that take place within the Scrum framework.
These ceremonies provide structure and opportunities for collaboration, transparency, and inspection and adaptation throughout the project.
Here are the key Scrum ceremonies:

Sprint Planning: This ceremony marks the beginning of each sprint. The Scrum team, including the product owner and development team, comes together to determine which
items from the product backlog will be worked on in the upcoming sprint. The team creates a sprint goal and defines the tasks needed to accomplish it.

Daily Scrum (Stand-up): The Daily Scrum is a short daily meeting where the development team synchronizes their work.
Each team member shares three things: what they did since the last meeting, what they plan to do until the next meeting, and any obstacles or challenges they are facing.
It is typically time-boxed to 15 minutes and is held standing up to keep it concise.

Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders, such as the product owner, customers,
or users. The team showcases the increment and gathers feedback, which helps inform future iterations and product backlog refinement.

Sprint Retrospective: The sprint retrospective is a reflective meeting that occurs after the sprint review.
The Scrum team reviews the sprint, focusing on what went well, what could be improved, and any action items to enhance their effectiveness.
It is an opportunity to learn from the previous sprint and identify adjustments to make in the next one.

Additionally, there are two important artifacts in Scrum that facilitate communication and transparency:

Product Backlog: The product backlog is a prioritized list of all the desired features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the product.
It is managed by the product owner and serves as the single source of requirements for the development team.
The product backlog evolves and is refined throughout the project.

Sprint Backlog: The sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog items selected for the current sprint.
It contains the tasks needed to deliver the sprint goal. The development team owns the sprint backlog and updates it during the sprint as work progresses.

These Scrum ceremonies and artifacts promote collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement within the Scrum framework, enabling teams to deliver value incrementally and adapt to changing requirements effectively.
